# April Dashboard UI (Prototype)

## Open
- Double-click `index.html`
- or run: `open /Users/nick/.openclaw/workspace/dashboard-ui/index.html`

## What this is
A static control dashboard to explain:
1. How April works
2. What access is available vs missing
3. Safe-mode guardrails
4. Suggested next actions

## Next upgrade (optional)
- Pull live values from OpenClaw status output
- Add activity timeline (last tool calls, last errors)
- Add model switch panel (OpenAI/Anthropic)
